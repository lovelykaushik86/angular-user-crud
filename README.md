# angular-user-crud

This is a basic demo Angular app, which is having CRUD operations implemented, i.e. a simple UI showing a list of users with Edit/Delete options. Also it maintains persistence while adding a user. 

This sample app allows the person to perform following operations:
- Add a new user
- Edit existing user
- Delete a user
